1 Getting Started
Before starting, you will need to verify that your GPU can work with CUDA or not. You can verify it using the following command:

lspci | grep NVIDIA

2 Get the NVIDIA driver installed
The simplest way to install the driver is from the "graphics-drivers ppa".

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-418

3 Download runfile from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone

4 Run the "runfile" to install the CUDA toolkit and samples 

sudo sh cuda_10.1.105_418.39_linux.run

NOTE: Un-check the "Driver" block and then select "Install" and hit "Enter".

5 Setup your environment variables
Make sure /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda-10-1.conf with content:
/usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/lib

Create file /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh with
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda

Use it by
source /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh

6 Test CUDA by building the "samples" 
mkdir cuda-testing
cp -a /usr/local/cuda/samples cuda-testing
cd cuda-testing/samples
make -j4
cd bin/x86_64/linux/release
